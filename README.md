===============
Server-side management of DaFlight users

=======

###Download
https://github.com/DaFlight/DaFlightManager/releases/

###About
DaFlightManager gives server owners fine-grain control over DaFlight-flymod users. It allows for features to be disabled/enabled, and even maximum fly/sprint speeds set, all defined by standard permission nodes. It also provides compatibility with the NoCheatPlus movement checks for Players using the mod - all other flight/speed-hack mods can still be blocked.<br/>

========

###Permissions
Nodes:
- **daflight.fullbright** - allows use of the in-built fullbright feature
- **daflight.flymod** - allows use of the fly and sprint mod
- **daflight.noclip** - allows use of noclip whilst flying (in creative mode)
- **daflight.speed.#** - sets a maximum fly/sprint speed for the user.<br/> 
      (Values of '#' can be defined via the plugin config)
