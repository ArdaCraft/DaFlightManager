DaFlightManager
===============
Server-side management of DaFlight users

=======

###About
DaFlightManager gives server owners fine-grain control over DaFlight-flymod users. It allows for features to be disabled/enabled, and even maximum fly/sprint speeds set, all defined by standard permission nodes. It also provides compatibility with the NoCheatPlus movement checks for Players using the mod - all other flight/speed-hack mods can still be blocked.<br/>
